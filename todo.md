# To do

- Can Wezterm really restore sessions on Windows? As it's now, I only get the tabs and panes with a suggestion for processes to run per pane.

# Done (in reverse chronological order)

- Make keybinds for:
  - CS-jkl to move to tabs
  - Remove a saved workspace
- cwd seems not always to be properly saved, making sessions less powerful. Fixed by setting it in OSC7 format in powershell config.
- Configure sessions
