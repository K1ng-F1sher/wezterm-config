# To do

- Remap `<C-c>` to `<ESC>`.
- Do I need the mux sessionizer? I seem to be able to reload sessions even without attaching to it.
- Maybe later:
  - wezterm.resurrect [here](https://github.com/MLFlexer/resurrect.wezterm)

# Done (in reverse chronological order)

- cwd seems not always to be properly saved, making sessions less powerful. Fixed by setting it in OSC7 format in powershell config.
- Configure sessions
