# To do

- Shortkey for opening wezterm as admin.
- Remap `<C-c>` to `<ESC>`.
- Maybe later:
  - wezterm.resurrect [here](https://github.com/MLFlexer/resurrect.wezterm)
  - wezterm workspace switcher [here](https://github.com/MLFlexer/smart_workspace_switcher.wezterm)

# Done (in reverse chronological order)

- cwd seems not always to be properly saved, making sessions less powerful. Fixed by setting it in OSC7 format in powershell config.
- Configure sessions
